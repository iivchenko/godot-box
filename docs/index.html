                        A week ago I realized that I am stucking with <strong>Space Invaders Game</strong>: I have to learn pixel art, music, sound effects and game dev in total
                        including <strong>GDScript</strong>. As well couple weeks ago new <a target="_blank" href="https://godotengine.org/article/maintenance-release-godot-3-2-3">Godot 3.2.3</a> 
                        was released. I made a decision to go easier: put <strong>Space Invaders Game</strong> on pause, check what new release can offer for us in terms of my beloved C# 
                        and make things easier. By eaiser I mean reducing learning topics like pixel art and GDScript.
                        <br>
                        And that is why I am started to implement <strong>Kenney Tower Defense</strong>. The idea is to try C# once again with Godot and replace pixel art
                        with free to use <a target="_balnk" href="https://kenney.nl/assets/tower-defense-top-down">Kenney Tower Defense assets</a>.
                
                        <p>But no worries. After I learn godot + c# game dev, music and sfx, write couple of simple games - I will go back and finish <strong>Space Invaders Game</strong></p>

                        <p>And now relax and see what I have for you - <a href="/games/kenney-tower-defense/index.html">Kennye Tower Defense</a>!</p>

                    <p class="body">
                        The game still in the prototype mode but now the game has all major screens like Main menu, Victroy screens etc. 
                        Also Heads-up display was added to display players scores and shared life pool that means you can't lost all of your lifes and watch how your partner do the game but
                        if you lost last life that means game ower for every one. 
                        <a href="games/space-invaders/index.html">Just go and smash the enemies!</a>
